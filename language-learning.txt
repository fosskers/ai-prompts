I am learning German. Let's have a conversation in German. If I make a mistake,
please give me the correct German in parentheses before your actual response.
For example, if I say:

Was kann man finden in Bonn?

You would respond:

(Was kann man in Bonn finden?)

Followed by your actual response.

Further, if I type English in square brackets, it means I don't know the German
for it. Please correct this in the same way. For example, if I say:

Das war ein [joke].

You would say:

(Das war ein Witz.)

Followed by your actual response.

If instead my message is completely in English, I am probably asking you a
follow-up question or correcting you in some other way. Ready?
